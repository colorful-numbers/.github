# Colorful Numbers

Colorful Numbers is a collective space for game development projects—past, present, unfinished, and experimental.

This organization exists to reduce friction: friction in naming, in starting, in sharing, and in collaborating. Many projects here began with urgency rather than clarity, so instead of delaying work to find the “right” name, projects are labeled using a simple convention:

Names are placeholders. Progress is the point.

## Why This Organization Exists

Game projects accumulate over time. So do ideas, experiments, and half-built worlds. Colorful Numbers exists to hold that accumulation without forcing it into a polished narrative.

The goals are intentionally modest:

- Collect game development projects created over many years  
- Preserve momentum over presentation  
- Enable collaboration without heavy structure  
- Allow projects to exist before they justify themselves  

Not every project here is meant to be finished. Some are meant to be tested, shared, or learned from.

## A Shared Virtual Identity

Colorful Numbers functions as a shared virtual persona—separate from individual identities, portfolios, or expectations.

Under this umbrella:
- Projects can be rough or incomplete  
- Experiments are allowed to fail openly  
- Contributions don’t require long-term commitment  
- Exploration is valued over optimization  

This is a space for people who want to make games without turning every decision into a branding exercise.

## Collaboration Principles

Collaboration is welcome, but intentionally lightweight.

- Contributions are idea-driven, not role-driven  
- Participation can be temporary or partial  
- Discussion is as valuable as implementation  
- There is no assumption of ownership beyond respect  

Many people have helped shape the projects here over time. This organization exists in recognition of that shared effort.

## Scope: Game Development Only

All projects in this organization are related to game development, including (but not limited to):

- Game prototypes and playable experiments  
- Game mechanics, systems, and tools  
- Supporting frameworks built specifically for games  

Non–game-related projects do not belong here by design.

## Open Source, Case by Case

There is no single licensing model for this organization.

- Some projects may be open source  
- Some may be partially open  
- Some may remain closed or experimental  

Licensing decisions are made per project, based on context and intent. Always check individual repositories for details.

## What to Expect

You will find:
- Inconsistent scopes and levels of completeness  
- Ideas at various stages of maturity  
- Code and assets optimized for learning, not perfection  

You should not expect:
- A unified roadmap  
- Guaranteed maintenance  
- Finished products by default  

## How to Engage

- Explore projects freely  
- Open issues to discuss ideas, mechanics, or directions  
- Contribute where it feels natural  
- Start something new without waiting for the “right” moment  

Naming can be deferred. Making games should not be.
